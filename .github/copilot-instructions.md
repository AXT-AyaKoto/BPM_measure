- This project does not use any external libraries.
    - It uses only web standards: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ECMAScript Modules.
- To check type consistency, we use JSDoc and `//@ts-check`.
- Since the developers' native language is Japanese, you must output comments and explanations in Japanese.
